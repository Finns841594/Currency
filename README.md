This is for my CS50 final project. I have it well done by deployed on website: 

If you need to try it your self:

1. You need to get a api key from Open Exchange Rate and set it as envrionment variable 'API3'

2. You should have PostgreSql installed. And set the database name, host name, user name and password as envrionment variables 'DBNAME', 'DBHOST', 'DBUSER', 'DBPASS'.
